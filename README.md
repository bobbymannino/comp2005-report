# COMP2005 Report

This is my COMP2005 report, in this you will find the [report](./report.md)
which will have the link for pretty much everything in it.

This repo also has the the source code for both the [API](./api) and the
[App](./app).

I also have a [TODO](./TODO.md) list to help keep me on track.

## API

To use the APi service, run the command `java -jar api.jar`. This will start the
API service on port 8080, if you would like to use it, you can access it via the
urls:

- [http://localhost:8080/patients/multi-staff](http://localhost:8080/patients/multi-staff)
- [http://localhost:8080/admissions/re](http://localhost:8080/admissions/re)
- [http://localhost:8080/admissions/never](http://localhost:8080/admissions/never)
- [http://localhost:8080/admissions/most](http://localhost:8080/admissions/most)
