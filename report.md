## Notes

- Me and sir spoke about weather to return objects or patient ids from each
  endpoint, we decided that being consistent matters more, so as long as im
  consistent, it doesn't matter
- use [JISC](https://onlinesurverys.ac.uk) for questionnaires
- use AAA, assert, act, arrange
- mention static testing (linters) and dynamic (unit, etc...)
- box testing (black, gray, white)
- code coverage
- edge/corner cases
- unit -> integration -> system -> usability
  - system testing: make sure its as close to real use case as possible
    (environment)
- mention about the port, what if it is in use?
- handle error if service is down, what to show user?

### Test Plan

- objective of test
- scope of test, what is to be included/not
- how long should the test last (in seconds/minutes)
- what type of test is it
- manual/automatic (github actions)
- environment? is it mac, windows, browser, chrome, webkit?
- assumptions
- notes
- measure speed?
  - if stress testing, how much slower does it get?
